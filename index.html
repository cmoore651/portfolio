<div align="justify"> My name is Ciaran Moore and I am a Student of Ulster University and am currently studying Computer Games Development. I have previously obtained a  Foundation degree in Computer Science (in association with Ulster University) where I achieved a distinction. My goal is to become a Games Programmer, working on anything Game-side such as AI, UI or even graphical programming. Over the past couple of years I have learned how to code using C# (also with .NET) and Java (also with Android) and have used other languages such as html, SQL, VB and CSS (not near the same extent as C# or Java). On this website you will see examples of my work in 4 main areas: Programming, Graphical Design, Web Design and Testing. Each area i believe will be of vital importance to me as i progress in the future, with the obvious introduction to Game Design (Which i have done, but not excessively. My Scripts however will be shown in the programming section). </div>

<a id="programming" class="anchor" href="#programming" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming</h3>

<div align="justify">Here you will see some examples of C#, C# Scripts, Java and Java with Android. I would consider myself more experienced with C# and would see it as the preferable language of the two that i know. This section will become a lot more populated as i progress with my studies and move on to other languages such as C++.</div>

<p><img src="http://keybound.co.uk/KeyBound%20Web%20Development_files/tempajc.jpg" alt="C# Script example"></p>

<div align="justify">I will not show all of this script as it is currently being used on a Mathematics project and is incomplete.</div>

<p>Click (<a href="http://pastebin.com/FxtdtfQA">HERE</a>) to check out an example of my C# work. To see more C#, download the Zip file.</p>

<p>Click (<a href="http://pastebin.com/DihWez0n">HERE</a>) to check out an example of my Java Work. This is Java (OOP) using Polymorphism. To see more Java, download the Zip file.</p>

<p>Click (<a href="http://pastebin.com/y7KaXiyS">HERE</a>) to check out an example of my Java Android work. There is too many activities too be display in order to understand some of the Java Android context therefore it would be best to download the Zip file.</p>

<a id="graphical-design" class="anchor" href="#graphical-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Graphical Design</h3>

<div align="justify">I originally wanted to go down a different path instead of Computer Game Development i was going to do a degree in Interactive multimedia and Graphic Design. However as soon as i learned how to program my mind switched. To this day i would still use the likes of Adobe Photoshop CS6 to edit things that use in Unity3d and for the web, however i will make use of my Deviantart profile to showcase some the my work and Games Designs in the future.</div>

<div align="justify">Please feel free to check out some of my work from the link below or by downloading the Zip file:</div>

<a id="web-design" class="anchor" href="#web-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web Design</h3>

<div align="justify">I completed a 15 week work placement in my Foundation Degree where I helped to setup a student Business. I, as the Team Leader decided that we would create websites and android applications. If you didn't already see some of my Java Android examples see above. Myself and a business colleague helped each to create our businesses website which we used as a center that displayed some of the projects that we undertook. You can checkout some of the websites that i created, using either website builders and hard code:</div>

<a id="software-testing--testing-methods" class="anchor" href="#software-testing--testing-methods" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software Testing / Testing Methods</h3>

<div align="justify">I have successfully completed a level 5 module in Software Testing where i learned and used many techniques and methods to test a range of software. I have also made use of JUint testing in my Java programs. You will be able to see some of my testing documents within the Zip File as well as seeing some JUint examples. I believe that Testing is a vital skill to have and many fail to understand how important of a skill it is.</div>
